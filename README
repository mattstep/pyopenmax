Raspberry Pi video decode demo.

This uses the OpenMAX library to decode video from inside Python with hardware acceleration.

The Raspberry Pi does not ship with audio decode VLLs so this only decodes the video stream.

USAGE

EXAMPLE A (play a complete video)

import pyopenmax
pyopenmax.play("/home/pi/transformers.mp4")  # Full pathname is required



EXAMPLE B (play video starting from 10 seconds in)

from pyopenmax import VideoPlayer
vp = VideoPlayer(videofile) 
vp.seek(10)
vp.wait()
vp.close()
